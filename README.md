Basic Understand about the Numpy


Creting Matrix or Vector(two dimensional array)

Creting Sparse matrix

Selecting Element(Slicing eliment)

Describe The matrix(Use shape,size,ndim)

Add any didgit in matrixAdd any didgit in matrix

Finding the Maximum and Minimum Value in the matrix(Finding the minimum and maximum in column and row by using axis)

Calculating the Averege,Variance and Standard(Find the mean value in the column and row)

Reshaping Arrays

Transporting a Matrix

Flattening a Matrix (you need to transform a matrix into a one dimension matrix)

Finding the Rank of a Matrix

Calculating the Determinant

Getting the Diagonal of a Matrix

Calculating the Trace of a Matrix

Finding the Eigenvalue and Eigenvectors

Calculating the Dot Products

Adding and Subtracting Matrices(We can simply use the "+" and "-" for subtracting and adding)

Multiplying Matrices

Another way to multiply matrices using "@" operator


If we want to do element-wise multiplication,we can use the "*" operator

Inverting a Matrix(You want to calculate the inverse of a square matrix)

Genrating Random values
